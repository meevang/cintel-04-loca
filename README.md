# cintel-04-loca

Action 1: Create a GitHub Project Repo
Login to GitHub. Click Repositories. Create a new project repo named cintel-04-local with a default README.md and a default .gitignore for Python. You'll both files for pretty much every real Python data project. 

Add File: A Useful requirements.txt

Use the GitHub web interface to add a file named requirements.txt. For best results, match the spelling and capitalization exactly - and paste in the following packages, one per line as shown below. You may add other packages as you like, for example, some may want to explore AltairLinks to an external site. or other interactive chart options as well. 

 

faicons
palmerpenguins
pandas
pyarrow
plotly
seaborn
shiny
shinylive
shinywidgets
 

Add File: app.py - the main Shiny app file

Use the GitHub web interface to add a file named app.py (exactly!). Paste in the content from your P3 Shiny app.py and click Commit to save the file. 

Verify your project repo has all 4 files and that they serve their purpose well:

README.md (note the capitalization)
.gitignore (it's an unusual name, but it must be exactly this)
app.py
requirements.txt
Your code is safely stored in the cloud - you can copy from it (and improve it) as you work through this module and complete Project 4. 

 

 

Action 2: Download Python
On your machine, install a modern version of Python. Python comes with built in tools, including pip - the package installer for Python. It will help us install additional free code for data analytics. Using Python requires pip skills. Allow time: the download may take a while. 

Download Python - Visit Python's official website., click on Downloads, and just download the latest Python version for your operating system. Don't start the install until you read the next section. 

 

Action 3: Install Python, Add to Path, and Verify
Install Python

Windows: Run the installer, check "Add Python to your Path", and click “Install Now”. Take a screenshot of this step.
macOS: Open the downloaded .pkg file and follow the on-screen instructions.
Linux: Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install python3).
Verify Installation

Windows: Open PowerShell and enter the following commands. Type each command by itself, using exact spacing and capitalization and hit ENTER after the command to execute it. Take a screenshot of your terminal after running.
python --version
py --version
py -m pip --version
macOS/Linux: Open Terminal and the commands are similar, but use python3 instead of py or python. When you find out what works, always use the version that works on your machine.  Some machines seem to use pip3 instead of pip. Find out what works for your machine and document your commands in your README.md. Take a screenshot of your terminal after running the commands that work for you:
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
Know where it goes!  Pay attention during installation and check the install directory. Replace USER with your username in the path below to find which versions you have installed. When I took that picture, I had the last 3 versions of Python available at that time. 

Windows: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Programs\Python

Take a screenshot after installation. Mac users will see additional instructions. 

Action 4: Get Help with Python Basics
Modern tools increase productivity greatly. Don't be left behind. Get your favorite AI and ask them to help you learn Python. They aren't perfect, but they are very helpful. It's easy to run the code ideas they offer and see if it works. Most importantly, use your AI assistant to teach you the skills and knowledge you need to be competitive. 

Ask your favorite AI assistant to teach you one aspect of Python basics. For example, ask about variables, functions, or data types, or how to use lists, or teach me list comprehensions, or how can repeat I repeat instructions in a loop. In your submission, link to the AI assistant, paste your conversation, and include a screenshot to verify.
